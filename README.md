# Lab1-Linker
 - by Jefferson Vivanco

Hello, this program implements a two-pass linker in 100% Java. To run this
program, you will need one of the sample input files. Once you have your file, you will
need to obtain the absolute path of your file, you will pass this absolute path as the first
command line argument when you run the program. 
 
If you don't enter a file path name or if there is something wrong with the file, 
the program will print an error message to the console and you will need to run the program
again. 

Steps to run the program : 
1) Open terminal or command prompt and navigate to the src folder of this program
Steps to navigate to this folder(In terminal):
    a)Look inside and go into Lab1-Linker (In terminal use: cd Lab1-Linker)
    b)Look inside and go into Linker
    c)Look inside and go into src 
2) In src do:
    a)javac linker/linker.java
    b)java linker.linker "Absolute path name of the file that you specified"
3) Voila! The program ran. If you entered the incorrect file name, or didn't enter one, 
    please run the program again. The output is printed straight to the terminal. 

I hope everything went well, if you cannot get this program to run, please contact me
