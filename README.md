# Lab1-Linker
Hello, this program implements a two-pass linker in 100% Java. To run this
program, you need to use the absolute path name of the input file you would
like to use as your first command line argument. If you don't enter a file
path name or if there is something wrong with the file, the program will
print an error message to the console and you will need to run the program
again.
